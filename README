Kismon
======
Kismon is a PyGTK based Kismet Newcore (since 2009-05-RC1) Client that
can use libchamplain to create a live map of the networks.

To use the map offline you have to browse the area and cache the map tiles,
they will be stored in ~/.cache/champlain.

Dependencies:
-------------

* libchamplain >=0.6.1 with python bindings (./configure --enable-python)
* libmemhis >=0.2.3
* pyclutter
* python 2.6
* pygtk

Create Debian/Ubuntu package:
-----------------------------

# apt-get install make debhelper python-support cdbs
# make builddeb

Note: The created deb has no dependencies for libchamplain and libmemphis,
because right now there are no packages with the required versions.

Install:
--------

# make install

Hotkeys:
----------

* Fullscreen: F11
* Zoom in/out: Ctrl + "i"/"o"
