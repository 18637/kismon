Kismon
======
Kismon is a PyGTK based Kismet Newcore (since 2009-05-RC1) Client that
can use libchamplain to create a live map of the networks.

Dependencies:
-------------

* libchamplain 0.6.1 with python bindings (./configure --enable-python)
* libmemhis 0.2.3 (optional for local rendering)
* pyclutter
* python 2.6
* pygtk
* python-simplejson

Create Debian/Ubuntu package:
-----------------------------

# apt-get install make debhelper python-support cdbs
# make builddeb

Note: The created deb has no dependencies for libchamplain and libmemphis,
because right now there are no packages with the required versions.

Install:
--------

# make install

Offline usage:
--------------

If you want to use the map without an internet connection you have two
possibilities.

You can to browse the area and cache the map tiles,
they will be stored in ~/.cache/champlain.

Or you can render the map locally, than you need an OSM file.
